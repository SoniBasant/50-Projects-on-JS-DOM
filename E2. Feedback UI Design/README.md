## Overview

Many times you were asked to give feedback. This project is about the same, giving feedback. You are presented with three options with respective emojis.

Unhappy 😔 | Neutral 😐 | Satisfied 😍

If you select any of the three and click on Send Review button, you will get a thank you message which also contain your chosen feedback. Satisfied is the default pre-selected option if you don't choose any feedback.
