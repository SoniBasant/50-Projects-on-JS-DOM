## Overview

This _Sound Board_ project is an interesting audio based project in this 50 project series. In this you will see six buttons with names _applause_, _boo_, _gasp_, _tada_, _victory_ and _wrong_. When you press them you will hear different sounds.

Instead of adding buttons through HTML, they are created with JS. Sounds are in different folder titled 'Sounds' and linked to HTML file with src (source) attribute.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Created, styled and added elements through DOM

### Concepts used

- forEach()
- array
- :focus
- :hover
- :active
- classList.add()
- element.innerText
- addEventListener() > click

Some more **important** concepts -

- document.createElement()
- .play() > HTML5 JS API for sounds
- .pause() > HTML5 JS API for sounds
- appendChild()
- .currentTime

### Continued development

Till sound play, we can see some colours and other graphics.

Need to work on background.

Your suggestions are welcome. 🙌
