## Overview

This project is helpful to learn about logic with an example. You can NOT have `Good`, `Cheap` and `Fast` project at the same time. You have to compromise atleast on one of them.

There are three toggle buttons for the same. Try to see which one gets unchecked when you try to check all of them.
