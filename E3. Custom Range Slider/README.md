## Overview

Range slider starts from 50, at center by default. You can also see the numbers at the top of slider. Click, hold and move the circle presented at the center of slider and digits will show you how much you moved.

## My process

### Built with

- JavaScript

- Customized CSS classes
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Desktop-first workflow
- Responsive design

### Concepts used

- getElementById()

- addEventListener() > input
- e.target > for range
- nextElementSibling
- .min and .max
- arrow function
- Template literals
- input type: range

Some **important** concepts -

- getComputedStyle() > to return an object containing values of all CSS properties of element

- getPropertyValue() > return a string containing value of specifies CSS property
- substring > to extracts characters b/w two positions
- scale() for conversion of one type of range to another > map a range of numbers to another range of numbers
- -webkit-appearance

### Continued development

Change the color of slider as number increases and decreases. Also make the digits non-selective.

Need to work on design and background.

Your suggestions are welcome. 🙌
