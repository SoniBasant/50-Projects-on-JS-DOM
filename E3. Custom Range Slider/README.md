# 44. Custom Range Slider

Range slider starts from **50**, at center by default. You can also see the numbers at the top of slider. Click, hold and move the circle presented at the center of slider and digits will show you how much you moved.

**Future work:** Change the color of slider as number increases and decreases. Also make the digits non-selective.
