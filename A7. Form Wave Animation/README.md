# 8. Form Wave Animation

It is a login form with an interesting twist. As you click on the input area; email or password; the placeholder will move upwards in wavy motion, word by word. After that when you click outside the input area, placeholder will move downwards in the same wavy motion.

Email has HTML5 validation error. That means it will show error if the input doesn't get email in its usual format.
