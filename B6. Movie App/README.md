## Overview

Using themoviedb API, we fetch some data about movies; like images, title, rating, overview. You will see different movies with the this data. This page also has a search bar.

Ratings have some colour coding for its range. Ratings higher or equal than 8 are in green colour, between 8(not included) and 5(included) are in orange colour and below 5 ratings are in red colour.
