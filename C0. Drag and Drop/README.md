# 21. Drag and drop

There are some boxes in the screen. To drag and drop, we have an image in one of the boxes.

Now you have two way to move that image. Either you *right click* on the image , keep pressing, move cursor to the box you choose and leave the *right click* on that box. Or you can *double click* on the image, image become movable. Now move cursor to the box you choose and image will drop there. 

While you move image from its position, that box and other boxes where you move your cursor, will have different background and border than others have, to indicate that image is on that box.
