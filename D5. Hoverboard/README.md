# 36. Hoverboard

This is cursor based hoverboard in which there are many boxes. As you move your mouse over them, color of boxes will change for a moment.

I add random color instead of one color. Also, you can change size from 15 to 16 and can bring it down to 14.

Future work: Make changeable size more than current size, number of boxes and shape of boxes.
