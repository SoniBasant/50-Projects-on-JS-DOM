## Overview

To show working of filter, we use API of randomuser. This API gives us data to display like first name, last name, city, country and image.

By typing any data, of course other than image, you can find the person as per your requirement. Like you can type united states and you will get all user who are living in United states. No need to worry about lowercase or uppercase.

## My process

### Built with

- JavaScript

- Customized CSS classes
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Desktop-first workflow
- API

### Concepts used

- getElementById()

- addEventListener() > input
- innerHTML
- forEach()
- createElement()
- template literals
- appendChild()
- classList > add and remove
- arrow function
- if..else

Some **important** concepts -
