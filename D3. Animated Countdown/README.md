# 34. Animated Countdown

As soon as page loads, you will see a countdown starts from 3 to 1. After countdown finish, you can replay it by *Replay* button.

The background of this project is customized by me. I got the inspiration for it from *Poonam Soni*. Her twitter account is **@CodeByPoonam**.

### Important JS and CSS concepts for the project

1. querySelectorAll()
2. classList > add, remove, value
3. forEach()
4. addEventListener() > animationend, click
5. nextElementSibling
6. if...else
7. @keyframes
8. transform, translate
9. radial-gradient
