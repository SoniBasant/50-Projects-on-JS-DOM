## Overview

This project is to check your water intake.

There is a big beaker and 8 small glasses. Every glass can contains **250ml** and beaker can contains **2L** water. When you click on the glass, at any position, beaker will fill up as well as the glass/glasses up to that click position.

If you click on the _1st_ glass, beaker will have _12.5%_ (250ml) water and _1st_ glass will fill up. If click is on the _5th_ glass, beaker will be _62.5%_ full with _1.250L_ water and all five glasses starting from _1st_ one will fill up. At any click on glass, beaker will show the quantity left to fill the beaker upto full level, in liter.

After clicking on any filled glass, it become empty as well as _250ml_ water deducted from the beaker that is _12.5%_.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### Concepts used

- querySelectorAll()
- getElementById()
- forEach()
- addEventListener() > click
- if-else loop
- classList.add()
- classList.remove()
- .length
- template literals
- arrow function
- classList.contains
- :root
- @import

And some **important**,

- element.style.visibility -> hidden and visible
- nextElementSibling

### Continued development

Need to work on design.

Your suggestions are welcome. 🙌
