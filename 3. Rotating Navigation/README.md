#Rotating Navigation

This project shows how rotating navigation works. As the page load, we have navigation at bottom left of the screen in column form and the content is rotated at some degree. We also have the option to remove rotation to read content and also to bring back navigation at the same place that is top left. Copyright of the picture belongs to me.

Important concepts for the project-
1. getElementById()
2. querySelector()
3. addEventListener('click')
