## Overview

In this _Scroll Animation_ project, You open the page and see two quotes with headings "Scroll to see the animation". As you scroll one quote come from right, next from left. And this continues as you keep scrolling.

This is exactly what this project is about,"Scroll Animation".

This project is very good for learning how to measure size of any element from different positions. Also, how to decrease the inner height of screen.
