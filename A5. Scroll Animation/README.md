# 6. Scroll Animation

You open the page and see two blocks with headings "Scroll to see the animation". As you scroll one block come from right, next from left. And this continues as you keep scrolling.

This is exactly what this project is about,"Scroll Animation".

This project is very good for learning how to measure size of any element from different positions. Also, how to decrease the inner height of screen.

Important JS and CSS concepts for the projects
1. element.getBoundingClientRect() -> to return a DOMRect object providing information about the size of an element and its position relative to the viewport.
I used ".top" for calculating position from the top.

2. window.innerHeight -> to check and change the height of window

3. addEventListener('scroll')
4. querySelectorAll
5. forEach()
6. classList.add()
7. classList.remove()
8. Pseudo class selector
9. position fixed for heading
10. transform: translateX()
11. transition properties for transform
