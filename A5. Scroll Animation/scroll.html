            <p>Just because things are broken in your life does not mean you can't survive. 
                Just because a relationship or friendship ended doesn't mean you can't survive. 
                Just because your job cut your pay doesn't mean you can't survive.

            <p>Quit trying to put what was broken back together and hold on to what's left until 
                you get to where Shiva is trying to take you. You can make it it on broken pieces. 
                Know that Every blessing doesn't come to stay.

            <p>Learn that Shiva gives you what you need for that season and if it leaves, don't 
                cry over what used to be and over what was.

            <p>Because if you needed it for the future it would've stayed. No good thing Shiva 
                will withhold from you. If He told you to leave that place or person, know that 
                it wasn't meant to be.

            <p>Be patient, in his time you will receive what's yours. Give thanks to Him for 
                everything, know that for this is the will of Bholenath. So you may not have 
                everything but thank Bholenath for what you got left with. Thank Him for the pieces.
