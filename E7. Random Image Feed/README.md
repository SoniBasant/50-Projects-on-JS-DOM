## Overview

Unsplash website gives us random images. At different height and width, we can get different images. Using JavaScript, we randomly change size, get new images and make a beautiful collage.

### Snapshots

`Images are random, can be repetitive.`

## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla JavaScript

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### Concepts used

- querySelector()

- unsplash website
- for() loop
- createElement()
- Template literals
- appendChild()
- Math.random() and Math.floor()

### Continued development

User should be able to enter the type of images user wants.

Changeable size so that user can get different sizes.

Need to work on design and background.

Your suggestions are welcome. 🙌
