## Overview

To know the keycode and code of any keyboard key, just press that key. This project will show its keycode and code. Generally, we need to get it from console of the browser.

All the keys, except space key, will be displayed accordingly. Space key will show as word "Space".

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### Concepts used

- getElementById()
- addEventListener() > keydown
- Template literals
- Arrow function
- Ternary operator

And **most importantly**,

- key, keycode and code from _KeyboardEvent_ (Use it from developer tools of browser)

### Continued development

Need to work on background and colour scheme.

Your suggestions are welcome. 🙌
