## Overview

This clock is theme clock because its colours can be changed as per Light Mode or Dark Mode. In our clock, we have an analog clock, a digital clock, AM-PM, day, date and month.

We have a button to change our theme from light mode to dark mode and vice versa. Only in analog clock, second's hand remains same red colour during theme change.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### Concepts used

- querySelector()
- array
- classList.add()
- classList.remove()
- classList.contains()
- template literals
- ternary operator
- if..else
- addEventListener() > click
- arrow function
- innerHTML
- element.style.transform

- transition, translate

And some **important** concepts,

- Date() to get Date, Day, Month, Hour, Minute, Second
- transform origin,
- map a range of numbers to another range of numers
- setInterval(function, timeMS)

### Continued development

Need to work on design.
