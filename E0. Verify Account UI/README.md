## Overview

To make your account in a website, sometimes you need to verify your email ID. You will generate a code which is send to your email. The same code needs to verify in a form.

This is that form. All initial values are zero by default. As you enter digits in the space provided, color of that block's border become blue.

I added color, orange, for the next one also. Additionally, if you press backspace, the current digit become zero again with orange border in that block.

## My process

### Built with

- JavaScript

- Customized CSS classes

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Desktop-first workflow

### Concepts used

- querySelectorAll()

- focus()
- addEventListener() > keydown
- if...else
- element.style.borderColor
- arrow function
- forEach()
- .value
- @media

Some **important** concepts -

- -webkit-outer-spin-button CSS pseudo-element to style input element

- -webkit-inner-spin-button
- setTimeout(function, time in ms)

### Continued development

After _backspace_, active one is in blue border. That should be in orange. Need to correct.

Need to work on design and background.

Your suggestions are welcome. 🙌
