# 50-Projects-on-JS-DOM
This 50 projects series is based on the Udemy course of Brad Traversy and Florin Pop titled "50 Projects in 50 days". These are mini projects from beginner level to intermediate level.

I used HTML, CSS and JS that relate to DOM (Document Object Model). Other than the course specifications, I also used my style in CSS and give some more functionality as where I can contribute. I also changed the content as per my choice and use my pictures instead of using from the depository of the project.

So, I can say that the projects are my own projects from the learning of the course.
