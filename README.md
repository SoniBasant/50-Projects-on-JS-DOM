# 50-Projects-on-JS-DOM
This 50 projects series is based on the Udemy course of *Brad Traversy* and *Florin Pop* titled **"50 Projects in 50 days"**. These are feature based projects from beginner level to intermediate level.

Projects required HTML, CSS and JS related to DOM (Document Object Model). Other than the course specifications, I also used my style in CSS and give some more functionality as where I can contribute. I also changed the content as per my choice and use pictures of my choice instead of using from the repository of the project.

So, I can say that the projects are my own projects from the learning of the course. Also, I am continuously improving style, UI-UX, backgrounds, functionality and many more.

To keep it in sequence, I used-
- A0-A9 for 1-10, 
- B0-B9 for 11-20, 
- C0-C9 for 21-30,
- D0-D9 for 31-40,
- E0-E9 for 41-50

### Projects are in continuous improvement.
