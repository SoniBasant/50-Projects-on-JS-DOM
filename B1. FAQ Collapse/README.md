## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### Concepts used

- querySelectorAll()
- forEach()
- addEventListener() > click
- Arrow function
- parentNode
- classList.toggle()

And **most importantly**,

- use UNI-CODE in content before and after
- font-family: 'Font Awesome 5 Free'; for UNI-CODE

### Continued development

Need to work on background and colour scheme.

Your suggestions are welcome. 🙌
