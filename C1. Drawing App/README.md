## Overview

In this `Drawing app` , you have option to change pen size from 5 to 50. Originally, It starts from 10. You can choose your color also from the color palette. A clear button is also there to clean the drawing area.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- HTML Canvas

### Concepts used

- getElementById()

- addEventListener() -> mousedown, mouseup, mousemove, change, click
- offsetX and offsetY
- innerHTML
- if..else
- :last-child selector
- arrow function

And some **important** concepts -

- canvas > beginPath, fill, stroke, moveTo, lineTo, arc, lineWidth, strokeStyle, clearRect

- canvas.width and canvas.height

### Continued development

Need to work on design and background.

We can add -

- Predefined shapes

- Input from keyboard
- Eraser

And many more functions.

Your suggestions are welcome. 🙌
